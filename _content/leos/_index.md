![Löwenware embedded Operating System](/leos/header.png)

LeOS is the new operating system being developed for laptops, smartphones and other devices based
on 64 bit ARM processors, designed with respect to an end-user's privacy, aiming to become a secure
and fast environment.


## Embedded Design

Keeping things simple, each build of LeOS is dedicated to work on a specific hardware, excluding 
redundant code and drivers from the core. It helps to reduce boot time and gain additional 
performance solving regular tasks.


## Freedom

LeOS is open source, free and independent. Flexible licensing policy allows customisations and 
adaptation for government, corporate or personal needs.
