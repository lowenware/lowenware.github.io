![Ilja K.](/about/ik.jpg)

Hello! My name is Ilya Kartashov and I am glad to welcome you in Löwenware - my software studio
established in 2017.

I have written my first program in QBasic when I was 8 years old and fell in
love with programming. Since that time I studied a lot about computer sience, networking,
web technologies and operating systems. Nowdays I offer my skills to various companies as external
software and firmware developer. In spare time I contribute to open source projects and develop
[LeOS](/leos/) -- operating system for ARM 64 and [AISL](/aisl/) -- library for web back ends.

## Performance Does Matter

Being and adept of high performance and optimization I always care a lot about how my applications 
work and how effective they are. I believe that if an end user have to wait for a web page longer
than it is required for downloading its content, then something was done terribly wrong.

As a developer I am very careful with choice of technologies and algorithms I use. And process of
finding the best algorithm for the task is what I enjoy the most in my work.

## Openness

I think openness is a key to a bright future of computer technologies. Collaboration of developers over
the world pushes the progress forward, bringing up better ideas and solutions. Wishing to be a part
of it, I publish my work on GitHub and contribute to other's projects.

## A Bit More Than Just a Software Studio

Löwenware is a very small studio. But it has a big goal: to create a 100% open source computer,
that will serve needs of humanity with respect of personal privacy and security, that will be
fast, robust and user-friendly, with a comfortable environment for creators and flexible policy
of software distribution. Today it is more than real and it is only question of the efforts for a
dream to become true.
