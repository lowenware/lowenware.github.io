AISL stands for Asynchronous Internet Server Library. It offers a unique
approach for back end development, by asynchronous event driven algorithms built
over an HTTP stream. 

## Quick start

By using [git](https://git-scm.com) starting a project with AISL is very easy.

# start a git repo
mkdir my-new-app && cd "$_" && git init
# add AISL as a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/lowenware/aisl.git
# initialize and start your application
make -f aisl/Makefile quickstart
```
