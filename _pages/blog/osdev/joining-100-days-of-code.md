Some time ago I decided to join the [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. I 
wanted to start on June 1 with a new Milestone from the [roadmap](/leos/roadmap/), but I feel some
lack of focus on the project due to other tasks, so perhaps it is worth starting right now. To get 
updates follow [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IljaDev).

Last two weeks I’ve been analyzing more than coding. Multitasking itself was not that complicated
to implement, but to really continue development instead of just prototyping, I needed a proper
virtual memory management, that was not planned before in such a scale. Nonetheless I’ve found an
algorithm to stick with and I plan a separate post about it. 

Today I’ve finished with the implementation of memory mapping. It requires more testing and
debugging though, but that will be my task for tomorrow. As usually the most recent code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lowenware/leos-kernel).
