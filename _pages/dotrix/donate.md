We are working on Dotrix in our spare time because we believe, there is a future of game
development in Rust programming language. It is something we do with passion and we enjoy the
results.

The biggest part of the founding comes from ourselves, but to keep it going we have to work on
other projects just for money.

You can support us and help us to make Dotrix better by becoming our
[Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/lowenware).

## Connecting the dots

DotrixBook is a sketchbook designed by us for IT specialists. Instead of lines or cells we are
using dots to markup the pages. It is perfect for drawing schemes, drafting UI and writing texts.
Now we are also sending it as a gift and `Thank You` to our sponsors.
