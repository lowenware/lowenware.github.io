title: How do we work?

## How do we work?

1. We learn more about your project and requirements.
2. Agree on our team line-up, engagement and hour rate.
3. We either integrate into your existing team or start the project
in agile sprint-driven manner.

### Trial

After the first sprint or month you can decide if we
continue cooperation, tweak it or end it up. Each sprint brings you
new working functionality, so it won't be hard to value our skills
and efforts.

After the first month, we insist  on compliance of at least 1 month
notice period.

### Development in Crisis

Sometimes it happens, that we take over projects with missed
deadlines or bad code base. We had it in the past and helped our
customers to successfully pass the crisis. We know how to work in
crisis. The more we know about your situation, the more effective solutions
we can offer. Just be open and lets find the way out together.
