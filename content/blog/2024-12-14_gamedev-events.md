This year I have visited two nearby gamedev events. The
[GamesGround](https://www.gamesground.de/) took place in Berlin on 14-16
of November and [GDS](https://www.gdsession.com) in Prague, which became
already a good yearly tradition to attend, on 14 of December.

Last year it was mostly about workshops and meetings with speakers. Worth
mentioning at least Brian Fargo the creator of Fallout and Wasteland series, as
well as Rhianna Pratchett, the video game writer and the journalist. Both are
great story tellers and now also a great teachers for our team.

This year it was mainly about meetings with indie developers and experience
exchange. I would like to thank the team of
[Sagittaras Games](https://sagittaras.com) for interesting discussion about
mechanics of their [Spellborn](https://sagittaras.com/games/spellborn) game.

There are also two games from GDS worth your attention:
the [Argent Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275010/Ardent_Wilds/)
which is very close to our game project in sense of mechanics and also the
[Robinson Crusoe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3197100/Robinson_Crusoe/)
with great graphics and atmosphere.

This time we also have some nice video materials from both events that will be
shared on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lowenware) later. So
stay tuned!
