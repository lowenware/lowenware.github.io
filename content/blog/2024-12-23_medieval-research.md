Working on 3D assets for Dotrix and for our game project we've realized that we
need a better understanding on how buildings and various objects from medieval
history period should look like. So in the end of 2024
we've performed a research trip to Nürnberg that brought us more than 2Gb of
photo materials as well as tons of joy and Christmas atmosphere.

## Fortifications

By just looking at these towers and walls people barely ask themselves, why
it is this or that angle, what is wrong with these windows or why the
direction of stairs does matter. But there is an experience of war experts
collected by ages and paid with lives hidden in the structures and the
architectural decisions. The fortress was one of the most attractive
points for us, so we could reproduce it as a game experience. There is a
lot of work to be done in that direction.

## Town houses

In that aspect, Nürnberg is a real treasure. The Tanner's Lane and the
Handwerkerhof provided us with everything we wanted to see: walls armatured with
wooden beams, tiny wooden windows, roofs, cornices, gutters, cart wheels and
even more. One thing that should definitely appear in our game is the wine
press.

## What's cooking?

Next year we plan to focus a lot more on the game project. A huge progress and
good news on terrain and world generator are on their way.

Also here is some preview of an abandoned house model for a mystery location
in our game.

We wish you a Merry Christmas and all the best in the New Year 2025!
