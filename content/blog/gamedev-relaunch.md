It is been a while since the last post here. It is all because of the very important and even more
positive changes in Löwenware. From this post you will know what was happening for the last half of
the year and what are our plans.

In June 2020 I've decided to hire a developer to join and help me with projects I've been doing for
customers. One of the candidates, his name is Stepan, had experience with game development. Based
on this, we've found many common points. I've been playing with OpenGL and C couple years ago and
I must admit that it was something I enjoyed most of all in my programmer's career. Stepan made
several games with Unity.

Long story short, I have convinced Stepan to start a gamedev project in Rust. After trying such a
great projects as [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs) and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engines
we decided to make our own: lighter, simplier and oriented on functions that game developers
actually need.

So, that is how [Dotrix](http://dotrix.rs) project was started. Sharing time between our commercial
projects and Dotrix, we've been progressing with the implementation. There was so much work and
so many administrative things to do, so I've completely fallen out from the blogging. Our
turnover has grown up, so we became a VAT payer and it took some additional capacities to handle
all the legal stuff.

Right now in addition to Dotrix itself, we have two game projects in work. One of them is simple,
to proove the Dotrix concept
and second one is much bigger. I will tell more about it in further publications, but what is
important now, is that we are developing features for both of them. On the top of the post, there
is a screenshot of the [world editor](https://github.com/lowenware/dotrix-editor) we are making
for our Big Project.
