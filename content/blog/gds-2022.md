The most stunning event of this autumn for us was the Game Developers Session
that took place in Prague on the 22-24th of September. The goal of my attending
was to become acquainted with members of game studios and indie game developers,
learn as much as possible about their in-corporate lives and of course listen
about their experience.

## 3D Engines

One of the questions that I asked almost everyone was obviously what kind of 3D
engines they are using and why. The answers were surprisingly similar to each
other. For older studios, it was a very common decision to develop their own
game engine from the very beginning. Younger studios, while often starting with
some proprietary game engine, at some point start to face the engine’s
limitations and have either to buy the source codes and rewrite them or to make
significant changes with self-written extensions.

So I believe this is exactly one of the issues that we want to solve with
Dotrix. We made it for ourselves, but we distribute it as an open source. Once
the community around it grows big enough, we can all benefit from contributions
to the code base.

## Workshops

It was always a tough decision, which workshop to attend. There were 3 of them
running in parallel all the time and all of them were very interesting. But few
of them I would really love to mention and thank to.

Appliance of AI in game development by
[Marek Rosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marekrosa1/) from
[Keen Software House](https://www.keenswh.com/). His team did a great job on
machine learning of their neural network. And while I dislike the idea of game
generation by AI, the usage of AI in games itself is a great thing and
definitely a huge step forward in the game dev area.

Very useful technical workshop about topology of network games was performed by
[Timothee Engel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothee-engel/), especially the
part about protocols relying on input and state change.

The most beautiful presentation (in my opinion of course) was performed by
[Veera Hokkanen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerahokkanen/) and it was about
the concept artist’s workflow in the game development process. Colorful
illustrations, interesting stories, useful tips. I wish I could attend many more
of such workshops.

## Conclusion

It was a very friendly event and it was definitely worth visiting. Next time I
hope we could attend it with our whole team and, who knows, maybe also as
exhibitors or presenters. Great thanks to [GDA](https://gda.cz)
(Game Development Association) for the organization and invitation. Looking
forward to new events!
