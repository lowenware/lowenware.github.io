From this post you can learn how to write simple bare metal program in Rust for
ARM AArch64 architecture, run it with QEMU on virtual device, attach a debugger
and disassembly it.

<!--more-->

## Introduction

Rust is a modern programming language positioned as safe, productive and
suitable for system level development. It comes with own packaging system and
various utilities for management, compilation, linking and even code formatting.
The language is very versatile and multifaceted, so it could take some time to
understand and get used to it.

I wanted to try it for programming for ARM AArch64, but realised that there is
not much information about usage of Rust for this architecture and all examples
that I have found were out-of-date and required some additional efforts to make
them working. So I decided to write about how to get started with Rust and 
AArch64 with a hope it will be useful for somebody else.

## Preparing Environment

[Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) - a toolchain manager
for Rust. The process depends on your operating system, but if you are on Linux
I would recommend to start from searching for package `rustup` in your native
package manager. Once you have it installed, execute

```shell
rustup update
```

Now you should have following set of tools installed on your system:
* rustup -- toolchain installer
* rustc -- compiler
* rust-gdb -- GNU debugger
* cargo -- package manager (in Rust ecosystem packages are being called _crates_)

In addition to that you will need:

* [QEMU](https://qemu.org/) - processor emulator
* AArch64 bare-metal target [GCC toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads) 
* Multiarch [GNU debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (optional, `aarch64-none-elf-gdb` from the toolchain could be used instead)


### Installing Toolchain

To compile a code for AArch64 we will need [nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#working-with-nightly-rust)
toolchain installed. To install it and set as default execute following command

```shell
rustup default nightly
```

### Installing a Sysroot Manager

To perform a cross-build it is necessary to have a `sysroot` for target platform with binaries 
for standard crates. Making it manualy is not something I would recommend to do, but fortunately
there are two third party solutions that can automate a process:
[xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo) and its simplified fork
[cargo-xbuild](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild). 

I decided to stick with `cargo-xbuild`, that can work as a wrapper for `cargo`, later you will see
it in action, but now to install it execute

```shell
cargo install cargo-xbuild
```

You will also need to install Rust sources for cross-compilation of default language
components. It can be done using `rustup`.

`rust-src` component using
```shell
rustup component add rust-src
```

## Starting a Project

Now we have all the tools we need. To start a new project `cargo` utility could
be used. Run it as follows

```shell
cargo new aarch64-bare-metal --bin --edition 2018
```

* `aarch64-bare-metal` - name of the project
* `--bin` flag says we are about to create an application (not library)
* `--edition 2018` - structure should correspond [2018's cargo edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2018/index.html)

Structure should be something like this:

```shell
+ aarch64-bare-metal/
| + src/
| | - main.rs
| - Cargo.toml
```

If you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you will find there is also
preinitiated repository inside.

## Writing a Program

Open your favorite text editor and bring content of newly created `src/main.rs`
file to this one:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
#![feature(global_asm)]

use core::ptr;

mod panic;

global_asm!(include_str!("start.s"));

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn not_main() {
    const UART0: *mut u8 = 0x0900_0000 as *mut u8;
    let out_str = b"AArch64 Bare Metal";
    for byte in out_str {
        unsafe {
            ptr::write_volatile(UART0, *byte);
        }
    }
}
```

Several things should be commented out here. First of all we use `#![no_std]` to
disable linking with standard library and `#![no_main]` to use other entry point
to our application than `not_main` function. Actual entry point will be defined
in _linker script_ as `_start` function and implemented in `start.s` assembly
file. It has to be done like this, because our program will start up on CPU boot
when there is no OS and stack pointer defined yet, so we have to do it manualy in 
assembly language.

To use inline assembly we should enable `global_asm` feature and then we 
can include whole file `start.s` using `include_str`.

We use `#[no_mangle]` attribute to disable [name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling)
and keep keep `not_main` function's symbol name as is at the same time with `extern "C"`
to use [C calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention),
so we can call the function outside of Rust code.

And the most significant part of our program is concentrated inside `not_main`
function. It performs character by character writing of `AArch64 Bare Metal`
string at address `0x0900_0000` which is a memory mapped address of
UART0 peripheral of QEMU.

---

Now create next rust file `panic.rs` in the same folder containing this:

```rust
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

#[panic_handler]
fn on_panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

We have to define `on_panic` function with `#[panic_handler]` attribute
as a handler that will be used by compiler in _panic_ situations. It is worth
to mention that Rust implements tiered [Unwinding](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/unwinding.html)
error handling process, responsible for calling destructors and releasing memory
in case of panic and continue execution of the application. It is a quite
complicated function that requires OS-dependent libraries, but for now we have 
no choice other than bypass it.

> I would prefer to keep this handler in `main.rs` for simplicity, but for some reason in that
> case compiler never uses a linker script (we will prepare it soon). And without it the program
> will be compiled for wrong entry address and may not work properly.

---

Now create a file `start.s` inside `src/` folder with following cotent:
```rust
.globl _start
.extern LD_STACK_PTR

.section ".text.boot"

_start:
    ldr     x30, =LD_STACK_PTR
    mov     sp, x30
    bl      not_main

.equ PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF, 0x84000008
.globl system_off
system_off:
    ldr     x0, =PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF
    hvc     #0
```

It is very small and simple. First we define `_start` symbol as global, then
perform initialization of stack with address `0x40004000` and call `not_main`
function defined in `main.rs`. Once it returns execution goes to `system_off`
lable where CPU shutdown is called using hypervisor call instruction `hvc`.

## Writing Linker Script

For our program we need a very simple linker script. Create a file named `aarch64-qemu.ld` in
project's root folder with this content:

```plaintext
ENTRY(_start)
SECTIONS
{
    . = 0x40080000;
    .text.boot : { *(.text.boot) }
    .text : { *(.text) }
    .data : { *(.data) }
    .rodata : { *(.rodata) }
    .bss : { *(.bss) }

    . = ALIGN(8);
    . = . + 0x4000;
    LD_STACK_PTR = .;
}
```

There are two important things here:

* With `ENTRY(_start)` symbol `_start` from `start.s` file is being declared as entry
point to our program, the point from which execution must begin.
* `. = 0x40080000;` is a memory address, where our executable will be loaded by
QEMU. How to find out that address and why it is important, I will explain in my next post about
programming MMU.

## Configuring Target

To get full list of supported targets you can execute `rustc --print target-list`. Common practice
of targets naming is usage of [triples](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple)
consisting of <CPU Architecture>-<Vendor name>-<OS>-<ABI>.

For bare metal program `aarch64-unknown-none` is preferable. For cross build we will need to
provide target's specification in JSON format. Next command will get default specification for 
`aarch64-unknown-none` and store it in file `aarch64-unknown-none.json`:

```shell
rustc -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target aarch64-unknown-none > aarch64-unknown-none.json
```

Open that file in text editor and add following snippet inside root object, to ask Rust compile 
to use our [linker script](#writing-linker-script):
```json
    "pre-link-args": {
        "ld.lld": ["-Taarch64-qemu.ld"]
    },
```

So in the end content of your `aarch64-unknown-none.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "abi-blacklist": [
    "stdcall",
    "fastcall",
    "vectorcall",
    "thiscall",
    "win64",
    "sysv64"
  ],
  "arch": "aarch64",
  "data-layout": "e-m:e-i8:8:32-i16:16:32-i64:64-i128:128-n32:64-S128",
  "disable-redzone": true,
  "env": "",
  "executables": true,
  "features": "+strict-align,+neon,+fp-armv8",
  "is-builtin": true,
  "linker": "rust-lld",
  "linker-flavor": "ld.lld",
  "linker-is-gnu": true,
  "pre-link-args": {
    "ld.lld": ["-Taarch64-qemu.ld"]
  },
  "llvm-target": "aarch64-unknown-none",
  "max-atomic-width": 128,
  "os": "none",
  "panic-strategy": "abort",
  "relocation-model": "static",
  "target-c-int-width": "32",
  "target-endian": "little",
  "target-pointer-width": "64",
  "vendor": ""
}
```

## Build and Run

Finally we are ready to compile the program! At this stage our project strructure should look like
this:

```shell
+ aarch64-bare-metal/
| + src/
| | - main.rs
| | - panic.rs
| | - start.s
| - Cargo.toml
| - aarch64-unknown-none.json
| - aarch64-qemu.ld
```

And building for _dev_ profile should be as easy as:

```shell
cargo xbuild --target=aarch64-unknown-none.json
```

And for _release_ profile:

```shell
cargo xbuild --target=aarch64-unknown-none.json --release
```

If you are curious about how `sysroot` is being managed by _xbuild_, you can add `-v` to these 
commands flag for verbose output.

After building `target/` folder will appear in project's root and compiled executables could be 
found inside:
* `target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/aarch64-bare-metal`: debug build
* `target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/aarch64-bare-metal`: release build

Difference between these two builds is that one from `release` folder is optimised and does not
contain debug symbols, while `debug` one does. Both of them are ELF files that are ready to be
executed in QEMU called with following parameters:

```shell
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt \
  -m 1024M \
  -cpu cortex-a53 \
  -nographic \
  -kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/aarch64-bare-metal

```

You shall see in terminal following output from our program:

```shell
AArch64 Bare Metal
```

## Disassembly

Disassembly is a very important part of low level development. You may want to use it for
troubleshooting, analysing and optimisation. This requires from the developer knowledge of both:
target architecture and assembly language. Experience comes up with time, but good news is that
AArch64 assembly is much more user friendly and intuitive than lets say x86.

To disassemble out program we will use _objdump_ utility from GNU toolchain:

```shell
aarch64-none-elf-objdump --disassemble-all target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/aarch64-bare-metal
```

Full listing has about 4k lines, so I will not bring it all here, but just one interesting part:

```plaintext

00000000400011b4 <_ZN4core3ptr14write_volatile17hf16241fac42e4551E>:
//  address:  code:     instruction:
    400011b4: d10043ff  sub  sp, sp, #0x10  // decrement stack pointer by 16 bytes
    400011b8: f90003e0  str  x0, [sp]       // store in stack value from register x0 (it has target address 0x0900_0000 in our case)
    400011bc: 39003fe1  strb w1, [sp, #15]  // store in stack one byte from register w1 (it has character to output)
    400011c0: 39000001  strb w1, [x0]       // store byte from w1 at address in x0 (actually output a character to UART)
    400011c4: 910043ff  add  sp, sp, #0x10  // increment stack pointer by 16 bytes
    400011c8: d65f03c0  ret                 // return
```

This is the disassembled function `ptr::write_volatile`, that we used for writing bytes to UART.
Here you can see mentioned above name mangling in action:
`_ZN4core3ptr14write_volatile17hf16241fac42e4551E`. But also you could probably noticed, how 
ineffective it is: instead of 1 instruction we actually need `strb w1, [x0]` we have extra 6 for
nothing.

> To be honest, when I saw it first time I was about to stop further learning of Rust. But 
> fortunately I did the same disassembly for `release` build.

```shell
aarch64-none-elf-objdump --disassemble-all target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/aarch64-bare-metal
```

And surprisingly listing is just 66 lines long, so I will bring it almost completely:

```plaintext
1: Disassembly of section .text.boot:
2:
3: 0000000040001000 <_start>:
4:     40001000: 580000de  ldr x30, 40001018 <system_off+0xc>
5:     40001004: 910003df  mov sp, x30
6:     40001008: 94000008  bl  40001028 <not_main>
7:
8: 000000004000100c <system_off>:
9:     4000100c: 580000a0  ldr x0, 40001020 <system_off+0x14>
10:    40001010: d4000002  hvc #0x0
11:    40001014: d503201f  nop
12:    40001018: 400050b0  .inst 0x400050b0 ; undefined
13:    4000101c: 00000000  .inst 0x00000000 ; undefined
14:    40001020: 84000008  ld1sb {z8.s}, p0/z, [x0, z0.s, uxtw]
15:    40001024: 00000000  .inst 0x00000000 ; undefined

```

This part looks very similar to what we have in `start.s` file with couple exceptions. I have added
line numbers manually for easier refference. On line _4_ there is a loading of 8 bytes address
from 0x40001018. And below on line _12_, there is an address where compiler had stored the value 
of `LD_STACK_PTR` which is `400050b0`. Similar was done for `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` constant, see lines
_9_ and _14_.

Now lets take a look on `not_main` function:

```plaintext
// listing of not_main function: all done inline!
0000000040001028 <not_main>:
    40001028: 52a12008  mov  w8, #0x9000000 // UART0 address
    4000102c: 52800829  mov  w9, #0x41      // A
    40001030: 52800e4a  mov  w10, #0x72     // r
    40001034: 52800c6b  mov  w11, #0x63     // c
    40001038: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    4000103c: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    40001040: 52800d09  mov  w9, #0x68      // h
    40001044: 3900010a  strb w10, [x8]
    40001048: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    4000104c: 528006cb  mov  w11, #0x36     // 6
    40001050: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    40001054: 52800689  mov  w9, #0x34      // 4
    40001058: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    4000105c: 5280040b  mov  w11, #0x20     // _
    40001060: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    40001064: 52800849  mov  w9, #0x42      // B
    40001068: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    4000106c: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    40001070: 52800c29  mov  w9, #0x61      // a
    40001074: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    40001078: 3900010a  strb w10, [x8]
    4000107c: 52800caa  mov  w10, #0x65     // e
    40001080: 3900010a  strb w10, [x8]
    40001084: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    40001088: 528009ab  mov  w11, #0x4d     // M
    4000108c: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    40001090: 52800e8b  mov  w11, #0x74     // t
    40001094: 3900010a  strb w10, [x8]
    40001098: 52800d8a  mov  w10, #0x6c     // l
    4000109c: 3900010b  strb w11, [x8]
    400010a0: 39000109  strb w9, [x8]
    400010a4: 3900010a  strb w10, [x8]
    400010a8: d65f03c0  ret
```

There is no call to `ptr::write_volatile` at all, but very well optimized for performance code:

* ASCII characters are being written directly to registers using `mov` instructions
* Letters `A`, `a`, `r`, `e` are being moved just once and same registers reused later
* No stack usage, no extra swapping of registers

This is just amazing!

## Attaching Debugger

Debugging is an essential part of low level development. When you are programming MMU, interrupts
or drivers, sometimes it is the only way how find out what is going wrong with your code.
For real hardware you may require external hardware debugger (and maybe even soldering skills),
but for QEMU virtual device you need just two additional flags `-S -s` to the command we already
used. These flags tell QEMU to pause execution, open a TCP socket on default port `1234` and
wait GNU debugger to connect.

```shell
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -m 1024M -cpu cortex-a53 -nographic -kernel target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/aarch64-bare-metal -S -s
```

Now it is turn for the `gdb-multiarch`, but before we start, lets prepare a configuration file 
`release.gdb` in project's root for it:

```plaintext
set disassemble-next-line on
set confirm off
add-symbol-file target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/aarch64-bare-metal
target remote tcp::1234
set arch aarch64
layout regs
```

Now run `gdb-multiarch` in other terminal window with following command:
```shell
gdb-multiarch -x debug.gdb
```

### GDB Cheatsheet

GDB has own console which is a big stress for beginners. But there is a small and easy to remember 
set of commands for a quick start:

* `break <fn|addr>` or `b <fn|addr>`: put a breakpoint, usage: `b not_main`, `b *0x40001010`
* `break <fn> if <condition>: conditional breakpoint, usage: `break context_switch if next == init_task`
* `clear`: clear breakpoint, usage `clear not_main`
* `si` or `stepi`: execute one machine instruction, step into if it is a function call
* `ni` or `nexti`: execute one machine instruction, but over step if it is a function call
* `c` or `continue`: resume execution until next breakpoint

## Afterwords

I've been working on kernel for [LeOS](/leos/) in C for a while. After implementation of multitasking, 
and switching between exception levels, I've started with MMU programming. When I made it works
I realized that it is a good time to make some refactoring and rebasing of all I have done.
At the same time I decided to take a look at Rust and even consider it as main language for the
kernel.

I have spent couple days on the application from this post, understanding Rust ecosystem and other
researches. Now when I am finishing writing I already know, that results of this will form the
basis of [first commit](https://github.com/lowenware/leos-kernel/tree/8474474351390c483bf2a668c4c5986c4dd1c44a)
to [LeOS Kernel](https://github.com/lowenware/leos-kernel.git) repository.
