We are glad to announce that LÃ¶wenware has been accepted as an official member
of the Czech [Game Developers Association](https://gda.cz). Looking forward to
new events, meetups and making our investment into Czech game developers
community growth.

We believe that our cooperation, possibly together with
[Lipo.Ink](https://lipo.ink), can help to attract new people, developers and
gamers, from northern region of Czech Republic into the gamedev area.
