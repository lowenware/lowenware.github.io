Dotrix is an OpenSource 3D engine for Rust developers. The name
is a derivation from dot and matrix. Two entities that both together
and separately are keystones of rendering.

The main goal of Dotrix is to power up our in-house 3D game projects.
Considering that solutions we implement can be usefull for someone
else we decided to make Dotrix open and free.
