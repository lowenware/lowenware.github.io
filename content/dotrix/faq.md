## Why Rust?

The idea to give Rust a try for game development appeared as soon as
we started to use that programming language for embedded solutions.
Its modularity, modern syntax built-in safety makes it the best in
general for such a big projects like games. On other hand, the way
how it deals with data types and generics, makes it very attractive
for all kinds of ECS (Entity Component System) programming patterns,
that we wanted to use.
